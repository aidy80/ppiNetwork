degreeDist:
To calculate degree distribution, I used some example code found in the 
following networkx tutorial link
https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/auto_examples/drawing/plot_degree_histogram.html:w
I would argue that this network does indeed take the form of a scale-free
network. As seen by the degree distribution, there is a clear pattern of there
being many low-degree nodes and a handful of nodes with high connectivity. 
Additionally, the entire degree distribution takes the form of a 1/x,
as is characteristic with scale free networks

Coefficient Coefficient: YGR296W and YPL098C both have 5 interacting
partners but YGR296W has a clustering coefficient of 0.1 while YPL098C has a
clustering cofficient has 0.8. This difference between the two proteins must
therefore lie in the number of links between the the interacting partners that
they contain. Specifically, because YPL098C has a cofficient that is 0.7 higher
than YGR296W, we are able to conclude that the interacting partners of YPL098C
interacted with each other more than the interacting partners of YGR296W do.
